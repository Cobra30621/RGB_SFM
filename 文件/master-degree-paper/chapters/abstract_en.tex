\chapter{Abstract}

With the widespread application of deep learning technologies in various fields, 
the importance of interpretable models is becoming increasingly prominent. 
While many "black-box" models boast high accuracy, they often obscure the decision-making process. 
Interpretable models, on the other hand, not only enhance users trust in the model but also provide valuable insights in case of anomalies.

This research proposes a new CNN-based interpretable deep learning model. 
The model comprises three main components: a color perception block, a contour perception block, and a feature transmission block. 
The color perception block extracts color features from the input image by calculating the similarity between the average color of different parts of the input image and 30 basic colors. 
The contour perception block detects contour features in the image by converting the color image to grayscale through preprocessing and then applying Gaussian convolution and feature enhancement. 
The feature transmission block combines the input features through temporal merging after Gaussian convolution and feature enhancement, forming more complete features that are passed to the next layer until they reach the fully connected layer. 
Finally, the output color features and contour features are combined and fed into the fully connected layer for classification.

There are three main datasets used in this study, MNIST, Colored MNIST, and Colored Fashion MNIST. 
The accuracy rates of MNIST, Colored MNIST and Colored Fashion MNIST are 0.9566, 0.954 and 0.8223 respectively.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model performs well in terms of both interpretability and performance. 
Particularly on the Colored MNIST and Colored Fashion MNIST datasets, 
the model not only accurately distinguishes images of different colors and shapes but also visualizes the internal decision-making logic of the model, 
thereby validating its interpretability and practicality.
